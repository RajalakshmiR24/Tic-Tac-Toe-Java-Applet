# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using Java AWT and Swing. Players can take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid, and the game will automatically detect winning conditions or a draw.

------------

##  Features
- Player vs Player: Two players can play against each other by taking turns placing X's and O's on the grid.
- Winning Conditions: The game automatically checks for winning conditions (3 in a row, 3 in a column, or 3 diagonally) and declares the winner.
- Draw Detection: The game detects when the grid is full with no winner, resulting in a draw.
- User-friendly GUI: The game has a simple graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons for placing X's and O's, making it easy to play.

## Technologies Used
- Java: The project is implemented using the Java programming language, which is a popular and widely-used object-oriented programming language known for its portability, scalability, and versatility.

- AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): AWT is a Java package that provides a set of graphical user interface (GUI) components, such as buttons, windows, and dialogs, for creating desktop applications. In this project, AWT is used for creating the game window and buttons.

- Swing: Swing is a Java GUI toolkit that extends AWT and provides additional components and features for creating rich and interactive GUI applications. In this project, Swing is used for setting the layout, fonts, and event handling for the buttons.

- Event Handling: Java's event handling mechanism is used in this project to capture and respond to user actions, such as button clicks, using the ActionListener interface. This allows the game to respond to player moves and update the game state accordingly.

- JOptionPane: JOptionPane is a Swing component used in this project for displaying message dialogs to inform the players about game results, such as winning or drawing conditions.

- Git/GitHub: Git is a popular version control system, and GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. These technologies are not directly used in the code, but they are commonly used for version control, collaboration, and sharing of software projects, including this Tic-Tac-Toe game project.

## How to Run
1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer if you haven't already. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html

2. Clone or download the project source code from the GitHub repository to your local machine. You can find the repository at: https://github.com/RajalakshmiR24/Tic-Tac-Toe-Java-Applet.git

3. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.

4. Build and compile the project to generate the executable Java bytecode. This can usually be done by right-clicking on the project folder in the IDE and selecting "Build" or "Compile" option.

5. Run the TicTacToeGame.java class, which contains the main method, to start the game. You can do this by right-clicking on the class file and selecting "Run" or "Run As" option.

6. The Tic-Tac-Toe game window will open, and you can start playing against another player or against the computer by clicking on the buttons to make your moves.

7. The game will automatically detect winning or drawing conditions, display the result using JOptionPane dialogs, and allow you to play again by closing the dialog.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the TicTacToeGame.java file.
2. Compile and run the TicTacToeGame.java file using a Java compiler or an IDE.
3. The game window will open, displaying the 3x3 grid of buttons.
4. Players can take turns clicking on the buttons to place X's and O's on the grid.
5. The game will automatically detect winning conditions or a draw and display a message dialog accordingly.
6. To start a new game, simply close the game window and run the TicTacToeGame.java file again.
